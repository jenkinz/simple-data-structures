# Simple Data Structures

Simple set and list data type implementations using various algorithms. These are primarily for learning and fun, so feel free to use/fork/clone or whatever.

-- Usage

Set implementations are in `/set`; lists in `list/`. In addition to the source and header, each implementation contains a `main.c` which provides a test function for the corresponding implementation. The test function takes two files as command line arguments, the second of which is optional. See each `main.c` for further information on the test function's output.

For example, to run the test of a linear array set:

- `cd set/linear_array`
- `gcc *.c`
- `./a.out file1.txt file2.txt`

-- Credit

I implemented these back in my college years for Darrent Atkinson's COEN 12 data structures class at Santa Clara University in 2006.
